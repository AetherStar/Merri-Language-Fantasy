# Fantazio de Esperanto

Fantazio de Esperanto is an Android game I made in 2014 for practicing vocabulary words in Esperanto (and also Spanish).

The original version was written with Gideros, in the language of Lua.  You can view this version on the [v1.0 Branch](https://github.com/Moosader/Fantazio-de-Esperanto/tree/v1.0).
This version is a rewrite and enhancement in C++/SDL2/Lua5.2 using my [Kuko Framework](https://github.com/Moosader/Kuko), so that it can be released for PC as well as Android.

View the [Issues page](https://github.com/Moosader/Fantazio-de-Esperanto/issues) for my to-do list.
